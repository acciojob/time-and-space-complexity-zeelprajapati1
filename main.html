    <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <!-- First Paragraph - Time Complexity -->
    <p>
        Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete based on the size of the input. 
        A good algorithm should have efficient time complexity to minimize the time required to run the program, especially with large datasets.
    </p>

    <!-- Second Paragraph - Space Complexity -->
    <p>
        Space Complexity is a measure of the amount of memory an algorithm uses during its execution. It evaluates how the memory usage grows relative to the input size. An algorithm with a space complexity of <b>Space Complexity</b> O(n) uses a linear amount of space based on the input size.
